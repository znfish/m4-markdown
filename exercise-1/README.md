# Exercise-1

As described in [chapter-5](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-git-and-github.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you will see the rendered markdown file.

See `complete` branch for an example.

```
“The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there
 
 to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people 

 who don’t want it badly enough. They’re there to stop the other people.”
